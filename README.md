## Performance Benchmarks

The following benchmarks were recorded using the provided Google Colab notebooks.

### **NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB (sm_80)**

| Operation | Tera-Operations/s (TOPS) | Giga-Operations/s (GOPS) |
| :-------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **ADD** | `0.597`                  | `596.5`                  |
| **MUL** | `1.303`                  | `1302.8`                 |

### **NVIDIA Tesla T4 (sm_75)**

| Operation | Tera-Operations/s (TOPS) | Giga-Operations/s (GOPS) |
| :-------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **ADD** | `0.119`                  | `118.7`                  |
| **MUL** | `0.253`                  | `253.4`                  |


* Achieving 1.3 Tera-Operations/sec for exact rational multiplication - 
 faster than hardware floating-point on the same GPU while maintaining 
 mathematical perfection.
